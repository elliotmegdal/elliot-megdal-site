                <p>Elliot Megdal & Associates ("we," "us," or "our") operates the website elliotmegdal.com (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you visit our Site.</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

                    <li>Social media plugins that collect data</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Information You Provide Voluntarily</h2>
                <p>If you choose to contact us via email at <a href="mailto:operations@elliotmegdal.com">operations@elliotmegdal.com</a>, we will receive your email address and any information you include in your message. This information is provided voluntarily by you and is used solely to respond to your inquiry. We do not share, sell, or use this information for any other purpose.</p>

                <h2>Automatic Data Collection</h2>
                <p>This Site is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub may collect technical information from visitors, including IP addresses, browser types, and referring pages, in accordance with <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub's Privacy Statement</a>. We do not have access to this data. GitHub's data collection is governed by their own privacy policies, not ours.</p>

                <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
                <p>Our Site does not contain links to third-party websites. If we add links in the future, please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.</p>

                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Our Site is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us immediately so we can delete it.</p>

                <h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>
                <p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), California residents have specific rights regarding their personal information. Because we do not collect personal information through our Site, there is no personal information for us to disclose, sell, or share.</p>
                <p>California residents have the right to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Know what personal information is collected (we collect none)</li>
                    <li>Know whether personal information is sold or shared (we do not sell or share any)</li>
                    <li>Request deletion of personal information</li>
                    <li>Opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information (not applicable as we do not sell or share)</li>
                    <li>Non-discrimination for exercising privacy rights</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not sell personal information. We do not share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising. We do not use sensitive personal information for purposes other than those permitted by the CCPA/CPRA.</p>

                <h2>Do Not Track</h2>
                <p>Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature. Because we do not track visitors to our Site, we do not respond to Do Not Track signals differently than our standard practice of not tracking.</p>

                <h2>Data Security</h2>
                <p>Although we do not collect personal information through our Site, we take reasonable measures to protect any information you voluntarily provide via email communication.</p>

                <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
